            To exercise your access and deletion rights described above, please
            submit a verifiable consumer request to us at:
            privacy@milkyscore.com
          </p>
          <p>
            You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice
            within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Provide enough information for us to reasonably verify you are the
              person about whom we collected personal information or an
              authorized representative; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
              properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
            information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
            the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. You
            are not required to make an account with us to make a verifiable
            consumer request. We will only use personal information provided in
            a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or
            authority to make the request.
          </p>
          <h6>Response Timing and Format</h6>
          <p>
            We endeavour to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
            forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to
            90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in
            writing. We will deliver our written response electronically or by
            mail, at your option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
            preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we
            provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
            request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will
            select a format to provide your personal information that is readily
            useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one
            entity to another entity without hindrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
            consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
            unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
            tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
            estimate before completing your request.
